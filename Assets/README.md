# Assets Directory

This directory is for all of the files that do not fit in the below catagories:

  * JSON files
  * HTML/HTM/XML (etc, etc.) pages
  * Scripts (Javascript, Python, etc, etc.)
  * Style sheets (CSS/SCSS)

Most files in this folder will be:

  * Images (png/jpg, etc, etc.)
  * MarkDown files like this one
  * Text (.txt) files
  * Other, more obscure files

___
Note: the package-lock.json and the package.json should not be included in the JSON directory. In addition, other files - such as the robots.txt file and the service-worker.js file - should not be moved into the directories that would normally suit them.
